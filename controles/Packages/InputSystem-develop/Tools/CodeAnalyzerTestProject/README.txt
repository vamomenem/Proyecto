This project is used to run the roslyn code analyzers on the Input System package. It works by enabling the analyzers in roslyn using a `csc.rsp` file adding the corresponding arguments to the roslyn command line. The project itself only contains a package reference  to the input system package, and a test copied from the package validation suite package (com.unity.package-validation-suite) which checks for empty terminal output to make sure  we have no warnings. The API analyzers used come from https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/api-analyzers (@dd297c2).

TODO: It would be nice to copy over neither tests nor analyzers, but to fetch them from their respective repositories. To do that, we'd need to get some changes applied to the tests, though (to ignore the "Project manifest update is not allowed on this project." console message, and to make the validation test package itself pass validation), and to move the analyzers to a publicly accessable repo.
